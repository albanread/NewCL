# NCL 

### !Beware this compiler and GC are all new ###


A from-scratch reimplementation of the Common Lisp / Corman Lisp **language and
user-facing experience** — Rust core, LLVM-based JIT, 64-bit,
Windows-first with a Mac port planned.

NCL ports some Corman Lisp source code and demos. It does not run
the original implementation's compiled artifacts (`.img`, `.fasl`).
Recompile from source.

See [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) for the design and what we have
committed to. This file will fill in as the system grows; the
manifesto is the spec.

## Status

**Working JIT-compiled Common Lisp** (v0.0.0 — pre-1.0; internals and
interfaces still move). NCL self-hosts its standard library and runs real
programs. It is **not** a complete ANSI implementation yet — see
*Conformance* and *Known gaps* below.

### What works

- **Compiler** — JIT-first, no interpreter. Lisp → IR → LLVM MCJIT (`-O2`),
  compiled per function. Optimization passes: self-tail-call elimination,
  unboxed `double-float` representation inference, no-capture closure
  elision, and IR-level inlining of `declaim inline` functions.
- **Runtime / GC** — a custom generational page-heap collector (G0 / G1 /
  Tenured), multi-mutator, with conservative stack pinning plus a precise
  inline root stack and card marking.
- **Language** — the numeric tower (fixnum, bignum, ratio, double-float,
  complex); the full macro system (`defmacro`, `macrolet`,
  `symbol-macrolet`, `&environment`); the condition system
  (`handler-case`, `unwind-protect`, restarts); CLOS (`defclass`,
  `defmethod`, generic dispatch; closette-derived); `format`, sequences,
  lists, strings, hash tables, structures.
- **GUI (Windows)** — *iGui*, a Direct2D MDI shell with a pixel canvas,
  menus, and a tick/event loop. Demos include a live neural-net + genetic
  algorithm tank simulation and assorted animation demos.
- **Standard library** — ~800 forms, JIT-compiled at startup from
  `Lisp/core.lisp` (embedded) + `clos.lisp` + `Library/` (loaded from disk,
  user-extensible).

### Performance

The yardstick is **SBCL** — the mature, gold-standard CL compiler, and it
is *much* faster than NCL. That's expected: SBCL has 20+ years of native
codegen and GC tuning. The goal for a young, from-scratch JIT is to stay
**within an order of magnitude**, and on a real workload we now do. Honest
numbers (2026-06, same machine, SBCL 2.6.4):

- **Symbolic / heavy-backtracking** (Norvig Prolog solving the Zebra
  puzzle, `demos/prolog.lisp`): **SBCL is ~10× faster** — SBCL 0.10 s vs
  NCL 1.08 s. SBCL was ~18× faster before this round of stdlib hot-path
  tuning. Closing to *only* ~10× slower than SBCL on a heavy symbolic
  program is the milestone here.
- **Float kernels**: NCL's unboxing pass makes its *own* code ~3–4× faster
  (it matches a hand `(declare (double-float …))` without the declaration).
- Allocation is competitive — `cons` is only ~2× slower than SBCL — and GC
  is usually *not* the bottleneck. The dominant remaining gap is per-call
  overhead: NCL's function calls are ~18× SBCL's, from a late-bound, boxed
  calling convention. The next compiler lever is an unboxed / known-call
  ABI to close that.

### Conformance

The Corman/ANSI test chapters (`demos/ansi-runner.lisp`) currently pass
**≈622 / fail ≈64** (≈98 of the remainder are forms that don't yet read or
compile). Most of those un-run forms cluster behind a handful of
single-feature *chapter-killers* — one unsupported construct aborts a whole
chapter at load time — tracked in [docs/ansi-killers.md](docs/ansi-killers.md).
The biggest remaining ones: read-time `#S(...)` struct literals (all of
chapter 8), LOOP's conditional sublanguage (`else` / `it` / `end`), and the
`define-setf-expander` / `get-setf-expansion` protocol. Other weak spots:
parts of the type system (`subtypep`, `typep` on compound types), some
`coerce` targets, and a few CLOS corners. The performance "gauntlet"
(`bench/gauntlet.lisp`) is ALL-PASS.

### Known gaps

- Not a complete ANSI CL (see *Conformance*).
- Windows-only today; the Mac port is planned, not started.
- No image / fasl save-and-load — recompile from source.
- Some GC roots are found conservatively (precise stack maps are future
  work).

## Building & running

Requires a Rust toolchain and LLVM (see [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) /
the build notes).

```
cargo build --release                              # console REPL  -> target/release/ncl.exe
cargo build --release --features gui-app -p ncl-driver   # GUI build -> target/release/ncl.exe
```

In a packaged release the console binary is shipped as `nclterm.exe` and
the GUI binary as `ncl.exe`. Run a program with `ncl.exe -l file.lisp`.
