//! Multi-threaded mutator state and cooperative stop-the-world GC
//! coordination, layered on `newgc-core`'s loom-verified multi-mutator
//! coordinator.
//!
//! NewCormanLisp supports multiple Lisp threads. Each thread holds its
//! own `MutatorState`, which wraps a `newgc_core::Mutator` (owning the
//! thread-local allocation buffers + start bits) plus NCL's explicit
//! root stack. The coordinator (`GcCoordinator`) wraps a
//! `newgc_core::GcCoordinator` and keeps NCL's lock-free card-marking
//! façade, static area, intern/macro/special registries, and GC stats.
//!
//! Stop-the-world is cooperative and driven by newgc-core: a mutator
//! that needs to collect calls `Mutator::collect_minor`, which
//! self-parks, requests a safepoint, waits for every other mutator to
//! park (or be in a native excursion), conservatively pins all stacks,
//! evacuates with every mutator's published roots, and resumes. NCL
//! cooperates by polling `poll_safepoint` at the top of every alloc
//! retry loop and at explicit `safepoint()` calls.
//!
//! For the v1 root API: each `MutatorState` exposes `push_root` /
//! `pop_root` / `root_at` / `set_root_at`. The conservative stack pin
//! (set once at registration to the thread's full stack span) catches
//! JIT-stack-resident pointers not in the explicit Vec; the two
//! together form the complete root set.
