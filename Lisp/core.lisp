;;;; core.lisp — the user-Lisp portion of NewCormanLisp's standard
;;;; library. This file is loaded by Session::load_core_stdlib at
;;;; session start.
;;;;
;;;; Everything in this file is plain Lisp using the primitives
;;;; defined by the compiler (cons/car/cdr, equal, +/-, if/cond,
;;;; let, defun, lambda, funcall, setq, setf). When a function
;;;; appears here it lives as a defun whose code is JIT-compiled at
;;;; load time and installed in the symbol's function cell — the
;;;; same path user code goes through.
;;;;
;;;; Conventions:
;;;;   - Helpers prefixed with % are internal; don't depend on them
;;;;     in user code.
;;;;   - Predicates that return T or NIL match Common Lisp.
;;;;   - Test-equality default is EQUAL (deep), not EQL. CL's exact
;;;;     EQL/EQUAL/EQUALP/:test distinction lands when keyword
;;;;     arguments do.

;;
;; Each follows the CL spec at the function-contract level — accepts
;; the divisor as an optional argument that defaults to 1, and
;; returns TWO values: the quotient and the matching remainder. The
;; implementations here cover integer arguments; `Library/numbers.lisp`
;; extends them to floats and ratios in the deployed image. Tests that
;; load only the core stdlib (Session::with_stdlib) see THIS contract
;; — see `tests/end_to_end_tests::ffloor_mv_baseline` for the
;; regression guard.
;;
;; MV-propagation constraint: the compiler's `instrument_tail_for_mv`
;; pass wraps tail-position function CALL expressions with
;; `EnsureSingleMv`, which collapses the MV slot to a single value. To
;; return multiple values, a function must have `(values …)` as its
;; DIRECT tail expression — not tucked inside a helper call at tail
;; position. Each defun below therefore ends with `(values q r)` at
;; the bottom of a `let`, never in a helper. (Same constraint, same
;; workaround, that Library/numbers.lisp documents at length.)
;;
;; Note: `truncate` stays as the native shim (single-value, exactly
;; two args). Wrapping it in core.lisp would conflict with the
;; deployment's `Library/numbers.lisp`, which snapshots the current
;; truncate into its `%int-truncate` parameter and would then chain
;; through the wrapper, recursing infinitely on the native lookup.
;; The native is exactly what floor/ceiling/round need internally:
;; `(let ((q (truncate a b))) ...)` binds the let-var to the
;; quotient, then `(values q r)` at the tail returns both. No
;; capture, no chain. The cost is that integer-only `truncate` keeps
;; its strict 2-arg signature in the test session — that's a
;; separate gap to close later if someone needs it.

;; floor: largest integer k such that k*b <= a (when b > 0; flips
;; for b < 0). Differs from truncate when sign(a) != sign(b) and
;; the truncated remainder is non-zero — bump the quotient one
;; further toward -∞, then recompute the remainder against the

;; ── TAGBODY / GO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
;;
;; TAGBODY is CL's primitive iteration/goto construct. The body is a
;; sequence of statements (conses) and tags (symbols or integers).
;; Execution runs top to bottom; (go TAG) transfers control to just
;; after TAG. The tagbody returns NIL.
;;
;; Implementation strategy — a PC-driven state machine, built entirely
;; from existing primitives (block / return-from / a simple loop):
;;
;;   * Split the body at tags into SEGMENTS. Segment 0 is the code
;;     before the first tag; each tag opens the next segment. A tag
;;     maps to the PC (index) of the segment it opens.
;;   * Compile the body to a function (lambda (pc) ...) that, given a
;;     starting PC, runs every segment whose index is >= pc (natural
;;     fall-through), wrapped in a (block B ...). The function returns
;;     -1 when it falls off the end.
;;   * (go TAG) rewrites to (return-from B <pc-of-TAG>) — a non-local
;;     exit that aborts the rest of the current segment and hands the
;;     target PC back to the driver.
;;   * The driver %native-tagbody calls the function repeatedly,
;;     feeding back each returned PC, until it sees -1 (completion).
;;
;; (go X) is only rewritten for tags X belonging to THIS tagbody; a
;; (go Y) for an outer tag is left untouched so the enclosing
;; tagbody's expansion handles it (correct lexical tag scoping).
