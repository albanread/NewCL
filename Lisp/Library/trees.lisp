;;;; Lisp/Library/trees.lisp — tree-walking primitives.
;;;;
;;;; Ported from Roger Corman's Sys/trees.lisp, Sys/lists.lisp, and
;;;; Sys/misc.lisp. The CL spec calls these "trees" — they treat
;;;; a cons-cell tree as the unit of recursion, descending into both
;;;; car and cdr at every node.
;;;;
;;;; Surface:
;;;;
;;;;   subst        copy with substitutions, :test #'eql by default
;;;;   subst-if     copy with substitutions, predicate-driven
;;;;   subst-if-not    "                     " inverted predicate
;;;;   nsubst       destructive variant of subst (rplacs in place)
;;;;   nsubst-if          "
;;;;   nsubst-if-not      "
;;;;   sublis       substitute via an alist of (old . new) pairs
;;;;   tree-equal   deep equality over cons trees, custom :test
;;;;   copy-tree    recursively-fresh cons cells, atoms shared
;;;;   revappend    (revappend list tail) ≡ (append (reverse list) tail)
;;;;
;;;; All accept the standard CL `:test` / `:test-not` / `:key`
;;;; keyword vocabulary. Internally we normalise `:test-not` to a
;;;; complemented `:test` via #'complement (already in core.lisp),
;;;; the same idiom Corman uses.
;;;;
;;;; Performance note: the non-destructive variants follow Corman's
;;;; eql-check on the recursive results — if neither half of the
;;;; reconstructed cons differs from the original, we reuse the
;;;; original cons rather than allocate a fresh one. For
;;;; substitution patterns where most of the tree is untouched this
;;;; is the difference between O(matches) and O(tree-size)
;;;; allocations.
