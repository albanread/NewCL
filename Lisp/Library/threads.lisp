;;;; Lisp/Library/threads.lisp
;;;;
;;;; Roger Corman's THREADS package, faithfully ported on top of the
;;;; cross-platform Rust primitives installed by the runtime. The
;;;; native primitives are intentionally low-level (raw integer ids,
;;;; mandatory arguments, no keywords); this file wraps them in the
;;;; documented Corman API surface.
;;;;
;;;; Roger's THREADS docs name the package `THREADS` with nickname
;;;; `TH`. We have a single global namespace, so the symbols live
;;;; in COMMON-LISP-USER like everything else; the names match what
;;;; Corman exported.
;;;;
;;;; What we have:
;;;;
;;;;   (create-thread func &key (report-when-finished t))
;;;;     spawn an OS thread running (funcall func), return its id.
;;;;
;;;;   (exit-thread &optional condition)
;;;;     COOPERATIVE — sets a "please exit" flag on the calling
;;;;     thread; the next (thread-safepoint) call returns T so the
;;;;     thread's own loop can RETURN. Roger's Corman docs say
;;;;     this "never returns"; that contract requires unwinding
;;;;     through JIT'd frames, which v1 doesn't support (no SEH
;;;;     unwind tables in our LLVM JIT yet). Until that lands,
;;;;     wrap your worker in a (loop) that checks
;;;;     (when (thread-safepoint) (return)).
;;;;
;;;;   (thread-handle thread-id)
;;;;     under our cross-platform shim, returns the same integer
;;;;     as the id (or NIL if the id isn't live). Kept for Corman
;;;;     API compatibility.
;;;;
;;;;   (suspend-thread id)  (resume-thread id)  (terminate-thread id)
;;;;     COOPERATIVE — the target thread acts on the request at its
;;;;     next (thread-safepoint). In tight CPU loops, insert
;;;;     (thread-safepoint) periodically so suspend/terminate work.
;;;;     suspend-thread parks the target inside its safepoint until
;;;;     resume-thread; terminate-thread makes the next safepoint
;;;;     return T so the worker's own loop can RETURN.
;;;;
;;;;   *current-thread-id* / *current-thread-handle*
;;;;     captured at load-time for the main thread. Inside a fresh
;;;;     thread, call (current-thread-id) — until per-thread special
;;;;     bindings land we can't make the variable update itself.
;;;;
;;;;   *current-process-id* / *current-process-handle*
;;;;     process-wide, set once at load. Same value across threads.
;;;;
;;;;   (critical-section)  class with accessor (cs cs)
;;;;     ENTER / LEAVE generic functions
;;;;     (with-synchronization cs . body)  macro
;;;;
;;;;   (allocate-critical-section)        — low-level id allocator
;;;;   (deallocate-critical-section id)
;;;;   (enter-critical-section id)
;;;;   (leave-critical-section id)
;;;;
;;;; A worked example:
;;;;
;;;;   (require 'threads)
;;;;   (defparameter *cs* (make-instance 'critical-section))
;;;;   (defparameter *count* 0)
;;;;   (defun bump ()
;;;;     (dotimes (i 1000)
;;;;       (with-synchronization (cs *cs*)
;;;;         (setq *count* (+ *count* 1)))))
;;;;   (let ((a (create-thread #'bump))
;;;;         (b (create-thread #'bump)))
;;;;     (declare (ignore a b))
;;;;     ;; Give the threads a moment, then read the result.
;;;;     ;; (A proper barrier / join would be nicer; the API
;;;;     ;; Corman documented doesn't include join, so we don't
;;;;     ;; expose it here either.)
