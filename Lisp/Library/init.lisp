;;;; Lisp/Library/init.lisp
;;;;
;;;; Loaded automatically at startup by `ncl` (the driver looks for
;;;; this file next to the executable, or under <repo>/Lisp/Library/
;;;; for dev builds). This file is the place to wire up things that
;;;; should be available in every session — analogous to Corman's
;;;; init.lisp.
;;;;
;;;; The core stdlib (Lisp/core.lisp) and Closette (Lisp/clos.lisp)
;;;; are already baked into the binary and loaded BEFORE this file
;;;; runs. So everything we need — defun, defmacro, defclass, format,
;;;; require, load, *load-path*, *modules* — is already in place.
;;;;
;;;; Out of the box this file does very little. Drop new .lisp files
;;;; next to it and add `(require :module)` lines below to have them
;;;; loaded automatically. Modules are loaded exactly once per
;;;; session (REQUIRE checks *modules*).

;;; ─── Standard Library modules ────────────────────────────────────────────
;;; Tier-1-and-beyond modules layered on top of core+CLOS. Each
;;; lives in its own Library/foo.lisp and is loaded once via
;;; (require ...). Order matters where dependencies exist.
