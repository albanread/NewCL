;;;; Lisp/Library/hot-reload.lisp
;;;;
;;;; Filesystem-watch driven hot reload. Drop a .lisp file in
;;;; the watched directory (typically `Library/`), save it from
;;;; your editor, and the REPL picks up the change between forms.
;;;;
;;;; The CL side of this is thin: the Rust `notify` crate spawns
;;;; its own watcher thread that pushes paths into a queue. We
;;;; drain the queue and `(load path)` each one at safe points.
;;;;
;;;; Function-cell semantics make this almost free: defun rewrites
;;;; the symbol's function cell atomically (see project_redefinition
;;;; _model in MEMORY.md), so callers using the old definition
;;;; finish on the old, new calls land on the new. No retirement
;;;; bookkeeping. defmacro is the same. defclass also rebuilds
;;;; the class metaobject in-place, though existing instances of
;;;; the OLD class don't auto-migrate — Stage C-style class
;;;; redefinition propagation is a future enhancement.
;;;;
;;;; Three user-facing entry points:
;;;;
;;;;   (start-hot-reload [dir])
;;;;     Start watching DIR (defaults to the first entry of
;;;;     *load-path*, which the driver sets to Library/).
;;;;
;;;;   (check-reloads)
;;;;     Drain pending changes and load each one. The driver
;;;;     calls this between REPL prompts automatically once
;;;;     start-hot-reload has been called. Manual users (scripts,
;;;;     long-running computations) can call it whenever.
;;;;
;;;;   (stop-hot-reload)
;;;;     Currently a no-op placeholder — the underlying watcher
;;;;     runs for the process lifetime. Stub kept for the API
;;;;     symmetry.
